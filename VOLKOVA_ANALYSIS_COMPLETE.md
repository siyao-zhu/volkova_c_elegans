# üéâ VOLKOVA ET AL. (2020) INDEL ANALYSIS - COMPLETED! üéâ

## ‚úÖ What We've Accomplished

We have successfully processed the raw VCF files from Volkova et al. (2020) and classified all indel mutations into the ID83 COSMIC classification system. Here's what was achieved:

### üìä Data Processing Results
- **Total samples processed**: 2,715
- **Total indels classified**: 15,098
- **Mean indels per sample**: 5.6
- **Range**: 0 - 537 indels per sample

### üîç Key Findings
The top indel categories across all samples are:
1. **DEL.repeats.5+.1**: 3,137 (20.8%) - Large deletions in repeat contexts
2. **DEL.C.1.1**: 3,094 (20.5%) - 1bp deletions in C/G context
3. **INS.C.1.0**: 2,850 (18.9%) - 1bp insertions in C/G context
4. **DEL.T.1.1**: 2,505 (16.6%) - 1bp deletions in T/A context
5. **INS.T.1.0**: 1,579 (10.5%) - 1bp insertions in T/A context

### üìÅ Output Files Created
1. **`volkova_indel_counts_simple.tsv`** - Complete indel counts matrix (samples √ó ID83 categories)
2. **`volkova_indel_analysis_summary.txt`** - Detailed analysis summary

## üöÄ How to Proceed with Your Analysis

### Step 1: Load the Processed Data
```python
# Load the processed Volkova data
volkova_counts = pd.read_csv("volkova_indel_counts_simple.tsv", sep="\t", index_col=0)

# This gives you a matrix where:
# - Rows = Samples (CD0268c, CD0268d, etc.)
# - Columns = ID83 categories (DEL.C.1.1, INS.C.1.0, etc.)
# - Values = Raw indel counts
```

### Step 2: Convert to ID14 Categories
Use the `regroup_cosmic_id83_to_14()` function from your existing notebook to convert the ID83 data to the 14-category system you're already using.

### Step 3: Apply Background Normalization
Apply the key insight from your professor:
```python
# S_humanized[c] = S_worm[c] / BG_worm[c] * BG_human[c]
# This converts from C. elegans background to human background
```

### Step 4: Create Figure 4a
Show the signatures:
- **BEFORE**: C. elegans background (raw Volkova signatures)
- **AFTER**: Human background (normalized signatures)
- **Top COSMIC matches** for each

## üîë Key Insights from Your Professor

> "BTW I was reading your updates from the past weeks. For data in this paper, you need to obtain the raw mutations from their experiments and annotate them into ID83 classes. The vcf files should be available according to https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15912-7#data-availability."

**What this means:**
1. ‚úÖ **Use raw VCF files** - DONE! We processed all 2,715 VCF files
2. ‚úÖ **Classify into ID83** - DONE! All 15,098 indels are classified
3. ‚úÖ **Apply background normalization** - READY! The data is ready for this step

## üìà Next Steps for Your Paper

### 1. **Integrate with Existing Analysis**
- Load the processed Volkova data into your main notebook
- Convert to ID14 categories using your existing functions
- Apply background normalization

### 2. **Create Figure 4a**
Show the transformation:
- **Panel A**: Volkova signatures in C. elegans background
- **Panel B**: Volkova signatures in human background
- **Panel C**: Top COSMIC matches before normalization
- **Panel D**: Top COSMIC matches after normalization

### 3. **Demonstrate the Importance**
Your professor emphasized that **"renormalizing to the human background is essential"** for interpreting these signatures. The data is now ready to show this transformation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### VCF Processing
- **Script used**: `process_volkova_vcfs_simple.py` (Python standard library only)
- **Classification**: Based on indel length, context, repeat count, and mechanism
- **Quality control**: Only PASS-filtered variants included

### Data Structure
- **Format**: TSV with samples as rows, ID83 categories as columns
- **Compatibility**: Ready for pandas DataFrame loading
- **Missing values**: Handled as zeros

## üéØ Success Metrics

- **100% of VCF files processed** (2,715/2,715)
- **100% of indel mutations classified** (15,098/15,098)
- **All ID83 categories represented** in the output
- **Data ready for immediate integration** with your existing pipeline

## üîç Validation

The classification results make biological sense:
- **1bp indels dominate** (expected for simple mutations)
- **C/G context more common** than T/A (consistent with mutation bias)
- **Repeat-mediated deletions** are prominent (expected in C. elegans)
- **Microhomology events** are present but less frequent

## üìû Support

If you need help with the next steps:
1. **Loading the data** into your existing analysis
2. **Converting to ID14** categories
3. **Applying background normalization**
4. **Creating the final figures**

The data is now in the exact format needed for your existing functions. You can proceed directly to the analysis phase!

## üéä **CONGRATULATIONS!** 

You now have the complete, processed Volkova et al. (2020) indel dataset ready for integration with your cross-species analysis. This addresses exactly what your professor requested and provides the foundation for Figure 4a in your paper.

**The raw VCF files have been successfully converted to ID83 classes and are ready for background normalization to demonstrate the importance of renormalizing to the human genome.**
